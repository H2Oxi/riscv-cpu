# riscv-cpu

this is actually from a big experment of our course IC2. This chip is finally taped out,and although it failed while we verifing the chip's function, but it only because the teacher choose a wrong strategy as same as analog circuit.
And my main job of design is to designed a high performance divider
which is based on radix-8 SRT method
